**additional_information** | **string** | Information about the velocity control applied to the transaction.  *NOTE:* This field is returned only in transaction response objects. It is not returned in address verification or card security verification response objects. | [optional]
**code** | **string** | Four-digit response code for address verification, card security code verification, or transactions.  For account name verification, the four digits correspond with assertions that the first, middle, last, and full name of the cardholder on the Marqeta platform match the data provided by the cardholder. &#x60;0&#x60; indicates no validation was performed, &#x60;1&#x60; indicates the match was unsuccessful (unmatched), &#x60;2&#x60; indicates the match was partial, and &#x60;3&#x60; indicates the match was exact. For example:  [cols&#x3D;\&quot;2,3,3,3,3\&quot;] !&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; ! Code ! First Name ! Middle Name ! Last Name ! Full Name  ! 0000 ! Not validated ! Not validated ! Not validated ! Not validated  ! 1111 ! Unmatched ! Unmatched ! Unmatched ! Unmatched  ! 3333 ! Exact match ! Exact match ! Exact match ! Exact match  ! 1232 ! Unmatched ! Partial match ! Exact match ! Partial match !&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  For address verification responses, the code is an assertion by the Marqeta platform as to whether its address verification data matches that provided by the cardholder:  [cols&#x3D;\&quot;2,3,3\&quot;] !&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; ! Code ! Address ! Postal Code  ! 0000 ! Match ! Match  ! 0001 ! Match ! Unmatched  ! 0100 ! Unmatched ! Match  ! 0101 ! Unmatched ! Unmatched  ! 0200 ! Data not present ! Match  ! 0201 ! Data not present ! Unmatched  ! 0002 ! Match ! Data not present  ! 0102 ! Unmatched ! Data not present  ! 0303 ! Not validated ! Not validated !&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  For card security verification, the code indicates whether the verification check passed and can have these possible values:  * 0000 – passed * 0001 – did not pass  For a transaction, the code describes the outcome of the attempted transaction. For the full list of transaction codes, see &lt;&lt;/developer-guides/about-transactions#_transaction_response_codes, Transaction response codes&gt;&gt;. |
