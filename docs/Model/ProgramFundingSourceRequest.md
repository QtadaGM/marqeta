Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**active** | **bool** | Indicates whether the program funding source is active. | [optional]
**name** | **string** | Name of the program funding source. |
**token** | **string** | Unique identifier of the funding source. If you do not include a token, the system will generate one automatically. As this token is necessary for use in other calls, we recommend that you define a simple and easy to remember string rather than letting the system generate a token for you.
